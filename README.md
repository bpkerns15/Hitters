The Main Components of the Sheet
1) A breakdown of stats by pitch type and batter side.
2) Hitter splits for RHP and LHP on a variety of stats.
3) An exit velocity heat map showing hitters' average exit velocity by zone location split up vs RHP and LHP.
4) An overhead heat map showing exit velocity by location from an overhead view of home plate.
5) Hitter batter average in the top and bottom part of the zone split by RHP and LHP (must be manually input from numbers printed in the program terminal)
Note: Stolen base numbers and OPS in the last 10 games must be inputted manually.
